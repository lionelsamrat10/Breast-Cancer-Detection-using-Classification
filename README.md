# Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
This project applies basic machine learning concepts on data collected for predicting Breast cancer on the basis of some characteristics of the tumor.

#### Software and Libraries

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 3.7
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Introduction

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at [Web Link]

Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.

The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

## Attribute Information

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

- Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- Texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- Terimeter
- Area
- Smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- Compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- Concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- Concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- Symmetry
- Fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
